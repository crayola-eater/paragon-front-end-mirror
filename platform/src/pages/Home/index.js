    our bootcampers to the practice of pair-programming and working in diverse teams from day one. 
    Since our bootcamp is now fully remote it's more important than ever that our teams feel 
    connected and able to build rapport, whilst solving problems effectively in a supportive 
    environment.`

    const intro2 = `To reinforce this idea we have created a bespoke game called Facts! from a highly 
    requested energiser that allows bootcampers to get to know a little more about their team members. 
    This sits within our collection of team building activities that promote engagement and 
    encourage a positive working model. 
    Click the button below to play Facts! now.`
